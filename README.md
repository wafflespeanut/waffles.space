[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/wafflespeanut/waffles.space.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wafflespeanut/waffles.space)

This repo contains the source and deployment scripts for my website (in a CoreOS machine). All my apps (including the [static server in Rust](https://github.com/wafflespeanut/waffles.space/tree/master/server)) are docker containers, exposed outside through an Nginx proxy (which is also a docker container).
