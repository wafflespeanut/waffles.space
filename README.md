## [waffles.space](https://waffles.space)

This repo contains the source for my [static server](./server) (in Rust, using [tide](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/)), assets and deployment scripts for my website (in an Ubuntu machine). All my apps are docker containers, exposed outside through an Nginx proxy (also in a docker container).
