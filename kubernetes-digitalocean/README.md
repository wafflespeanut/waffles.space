### Future on Kubernetes

I'm planning to move into Kubernetes at some point. I already [have a Python script](https://github.com/wafflespeanut/waffles.space/blob/master/kubernetes-digitalocean/setup-nodes.py) for deploying Kubernetes in CoreOS machines in DigitalOcean. But, when it comes to single-node cluster of master and worker, it seems to cause *indeterministic* issues every now and then. So, until I find a way around it, I'll be sticking with docker containers.
